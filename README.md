# Infinite Scroll Webpage

A modern, responsive webpage demonstrating infinite scrolling functionality built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically loads more content as you scroll down
- **Modern UI Design**: Beautiful gradient background with clean, card-based layout
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Loading Animation**: Smooth loading spinner with fade-in animations
- **Dynamic Content**: Generates random content with titles, descriptions, categories, and dates
- **Scroll Indicator**: Visual indicator showing when more content is available
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient scroll event handling with debouncing

## How It Works

1. **Initial Load**: The page loads with the first 10 content items
2. **Scroll Detection**: JavaScript monitors scroll position using `window.addEventListener('scroll')`
3. **Trigger Point**: When user scrolls within 100px of the bottom, new content is requested
4. **Content Generation**: New items are dynamically created with random content
5. **Smooth Loading**: Loading spinner appears during content generation
6. **Infinite Loop**: Process continues until maximum content limit (50 items) is reached
